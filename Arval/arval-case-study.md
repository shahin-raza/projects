# Arval (Apollo) – Drupal Case Study  
**Fleet Management Platform – Multi-site Drupal Implementation**

## 📌 Project Overview
Arval, a global vehicle leasing and fleet management company, required a scalable digital platform to support partners, clients, and operational teams across multiple European markets.  
The objective was to build a centralized Drupal-based system capable of handling country-specific workflows, dashboards, reporting, and integrations while maintaining high performance and security standards.

The Apollo platform runs **120+ multisite and multilingual websites** on a single codebase, enabling fast and flexible component-based content delivery across regions.
