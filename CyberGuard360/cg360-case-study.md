# 🚀 Project Overview
CyberGuard360 required extensive backend development to support high-volume data processing, enterprise security integrations, role-based access management, and automated compliance workflows.  
The system was built using **Drupal 7** with deep customizations, external API integrations, and multi-tenant logic for MSPs and clients.

This project involved designing secure workflows, building high-performance custom modules, and integrating third-party systems such as GoPhish, Azure AD, and Dark Web monitoring services.
